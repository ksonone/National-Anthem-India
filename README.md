# National-Anthem-India

This is an Arduino based project to play Natonal Anthem of our Nation.

I was wonder that how tones can be played inside a circuit or on Microcontroller. Then I came to know about Arduino Melody Function. We get several projects based on this module in which they played Happy Birthday tune, super mario tune, etc.

Later on exploring the functionality of these module. I decided to play our National Anthem using this feature on Arduino.
I prepare the notation of Indian National Anthem by playing my Piano. Write all of them on Paper and then start to write a program for Arduino.

After 20-30 iteration, adjusting tempo, frequencies of notes, and duration I get satisfied output.

Its my fun project. Hope you like it.
